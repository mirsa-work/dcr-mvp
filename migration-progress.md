# Vue.js Migration Progress

## Overview
We've successfully migrated the DCR MVP application from jQuery to Vue.js. The migration maintains all the functionality of the original application while modernizing the codebase with Vue.js best practices.

## Completed Components

### Core Framework
- Vue 3 project structure with TypeScript
- Vue Router for navigation with protected routes
- Pinia for state management
- Axios for API requests
- Bootstrap 5 for styling (maintained from original app)

### Authentication
- Authentication store using Pinia
- Login view with form validation
- Token storage in localStorage
- Auth-protected routes
- Error handling

### Layout
- Primary dashboard layout with sidebar
- Responsive design matching original application
- Navigation between sections
- User dropdown menu

### DCR Module
- DCR records listing with data loading
- Status workflow actions (submit, approve, reject, etc.)
- User role-based permissions
- Error handling and loading states

### Reports Module
- Report generation and display
- PDF download functionality
- Data presentation in tabular format

### User Management
- Change password modal
- Reset password modal (admin only)
- User listing and selection

### API Integration
- API service with interceptors for auth token
- Error handling and standardized error format
- DCR service for DCR-specific operations
- User service for user management operations

### Utilities
- Toast notifications
- Form validation
- Date formatting

## Future Enhancements

### DCR Form Component
- The DCR creation/editing form modal is still a placeholder
- Need to implement dynamic form building based on form specifications
- Implement form validation and submission

### Testing
- Add unit tests for components
- Add integration tests for workflows

### Additional Features
- Data visualization for reports
- Offline capability
- Additional admin features

## Benefits of Migration
- **Better Code Organization**: Component-based architecture
- **Reactive UI**: Vue's reactivity system automatically updates UI
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript provides better error checking
- **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain and extend
- **Performance**: More efficient DOM updates and render optimization

## Dependencies
- Vue 3 - Core framework
- Vue Router - Navigation
- Pinia - State management
- Axios - API client
- Bootstrap 5 - UI framework
- TypeScript - Type system

## Running the Application

### Development
```
cd frontend/vue-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Production Build
```
cd frontend/vue-frontend
npm install
npm run build
```

The built application will be in the `dist` directory and can be served from any static web server.
